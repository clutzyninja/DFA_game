Level 1 - 10
1 being the easiest and 10 is the hardest

1. Create a DFA that only accepts string a,b
2. Create a DFA that accepts string a or string b
3. Create a DFA that accepts bbbaaa.
4. Create a DFA with |Q |= 3 and |Σ|= 3.
   Give a string of length 7 that is accepted and a
   string of length 5 that is rejected
5. Create a DFA with Σ = {a,b}
   that accepts precisely the strings that contain an
   even number of a’s and exactly one b.
6. Create a DFA with Σ = {a,b}
   that accepts precisely the strings that contain at
   least 2 a’s and at least 3 b’s.
7. Create a DFA where all strings of the language starts with substring “a”.
8. Create a DFA for the language accepting strings starting with ‘ab’ over input alphabets ∑ = {a, b}
9. Create a DFA for the language accepting strings starting with ‘101’ over input alphabets ∑ = {0, 1}
10. Construct a DFA that accepts a language L over input alphabets ∑ = {a, b} such that L is the set of all strings starting with ‘aa’ or ‘bb’.
